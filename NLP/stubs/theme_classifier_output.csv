192,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 We’re sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 I’ll give it to you straight…
 Your next mission was commissioned by a certain Feudal Lord’s daughter.
 You are to act as her double.
 I don’t know where she heard about you,
 but you apparently bear a striking resemblance to the princess.
 Therefore she requested that you be the one who carries it out…
 A double…?
 Is someone targeting the princess?
 Well, if anything, she’s the one who’s doing the targeting…
 Huh?
 Not to worry.
 You’re already an admirable Hidden Leaf Shinobi.
 Furthermore, I’ve arranged for you to have an assistant.
 Assistant?
 Grandma Tsunade! You have a mission for me?
 And one from a Feudal Lord to boot!
 Huh?! 					Lady Tsunade!
 Sorry, but all the other guys are too busy.
 Just me and this guy?
 Yup. Do your best to carry out the mission.
 The client is a Feudal Lord’s daughter, huh…
 Wow… I guess that means that I’ve finally became good enough
 to handle amazing missions like this, huh?!
 Hey, don’t get too excited.
 Terrible things happen when you're like that.
 I know… Just leave things in my capable hands!
 You’re really a piece of work…
 Ino Screams! Chubby Paradise!
 Thank you for coming from afar.
 That’s the client?
 She and Ino really do look alike, but…
 I-It’s a bit of a stretch…
 It’s all right. I have an idea of what you wish to say.
 My physique doesn’t really resemble that of the double there…
 That’s what you’re thinking, right?
 – Oh…not at all… Umm… – To be honest,
 – I don’t think you resemble her at all. – Hey!
 Well, I don’t blame you for thinking that. But here, have a look at this!
 T-That’s…lno!
 That’s what I looked like a short time ago…
 Truth be told, I only got like this
 after it was decided that I was to have an arranged courtship.
 An arranged courtship?!
 The other party is Master Chikara from the neighboring Land of Udon.
 Ever since I saw his picture,
 my feelings for him have deepened day by day.
 And as the day of the arranged courtship grows closer,
 I have become increasingly nervous, my cheeks have been flushed,
 and my heart has been pounding.
 I can’t even sleep at night.
 And because of that stress, I’ve started overeating…
 It goes without saying that you’ll get fat if you pig out.
 Of course, I’ve taken appropriate countermeasures!
 I’ve been using something that cuts all the fats and carbohydrates that I ingest…
 ""Easy-Peasy Slim Special”
 It didn’t work, did it?
 I placed too strong hopes in it…
 How can I possibly have an arranged courtship
 with the man I’m infatuated with when I look like this?
 So that’s my situation… Now, let’s get to the main issue.
 I want you to attend the arranged courtship in my place
 and make it a success at any cost.
 Huh?! 					So this double thing
 is just to act on you behalf at some arranged courtship?!
 What do you mean by “some arranged courtship”?!
 I mean, when you talk about doubles, you thinks of situations
 where someone’s life is in danger and that sort of thing.
 What are you talking about?!
 The princess’s entire life is at stake! This is major!
 Oh! So you understand a heart in love…
 I sure do… A girl always wants to look cute
 for the guy she loves.
 Even if she’s a fake…?
 It can’t be helped. I mean, guys prefer slender girls.
 That’s exactly right!
 I’m counting on you.
 Sure thing! Leave it to me!
 But even if the arranged courtship goes well…
 The gap is just too big.
 I’ll just have to lose weight by the day of the wedding.
 I already have a plan in place for that.
 This supplemental type diet food, “Supplement Slender”!
 If I supplement all three meals with this…
 Why don’t you draw on the lessons you’re supposed to have learned…?
 In any case, I’ll use my charms to make this arranged courtship a success!
 This annex is where I often played in my childhood.
 I plan to use this to listen in on the arranged courtship from here.
 Huh… That’s pretty convenient.
 I would love to meet him in person if I could, but…
 Hey, is he that cool looking?
 Of course he is!
 He’s someone with something really special about him!
 Well then, just make sure he falls for you.
 Leave it to me!
 I thought you weren’t motivated…
 Well, this is a mission after all.
 So I think I’ll pull myself together and hustle!
 Don’t do anything unnecessary, okay!
 W-What’s up?
 The sound is getting closer!
 – What? 					– It’s so bright!
 There are many a handsome man in this world,
 but this man is renowned even among them!
 This man makes Land of Udon what it is…
 that sexy man with glistening sidelong glances!
 The oh-so-great young prince Chikara…
 Kneel down and bow before him!
 Sorry.
 It appears that I have kept you waiting, princess
 You're…Master Chikara?
 He’s even more intense than lntense-Brow Sensei.
 I’m sorry, pretty girl.
 I have constitutional low blood pressure.
 Dunno. He looks more like he has high blood pressure to me…
 What?
 D-Do you always scatter flower petals?
 Flowers are wonderful.
 They truly allay the fatigue of your mind and your body.
 Don’t you find them relaxing?
 I-I guess…
 Okay then, next…
 Hey, don’t you think he’s different from her description…?
 I mean, he’s fa…
 Fa…?!
 Stop!
 These sweets are really fabulous, aren't they?
 Do excuse us a little.
 What the heck are you doing, out of the blue like that?!
 It’s women’s intuition.
 I got the same vibe from him as Choji.
 That word is probably taboo.
 Oh, I see!
 Gimme a break!
 What’s up with that uselessly intense chubby guy showing up
 when she told us he’d be a handsome prince?!
 But wouldn’t his physique be a perfect match for her?
 I’m sure there must be some mistake.
 There’s no way a girl would fall in love with a guy like that.
 But maybe that’s the princess’ taste in men…
 That’s impossible. I mean…
 He’s flashy…!
 Intense…!
 And a fatso!
 He’s a freak! A freak!
 There’s gotta be a mistake! I’m sure of it!
 Y-You think so?
 What are you saying?
 There’s no mistake that that’s Master Chikara, the man of my heart.
 I thought so…
 What an elegant man…
 I deeply regret that I cannot see him up close with my very own eyes.
 I guess one could say that everybody has their own set of woes.
 Listen, make sure that he takes a liking to me no matter what!
 Stop complaining and get the ball rolling with dogged persistence!
 I will convey that to her.
 Has you tension not eased? Music is good for relaxation.
 Please, you need not go to the trouble…
 – What did she say? – She said there’s no mistake.
 She wants you to bulldoze on ahead!
 I can’t believe it!
 It’s our mission, you know!
 I know that…
 Princess Fuku…do you like roses?
 Yes…very much so…
 Great! 					I love roses too!
 In the language of flowers, they signify love!
 But don't their meanings differ depending on their color?
 For example, yellow roses are supposed to mean “Let’s break up”…
 It’s nonsense to discriminate because of color…
 I mean the flowers are not at fault, after all.
 For you.
 Hey…wait!
 Huh?
 I can’t do it! I can’t do it!
 There’s no way! He’s too intense.
 There’s no way I can act as a substitute for the princess!
 Calm down. Stop saying that and do your best.
 Nope. I just can’t stand him physically.
 Oh, I got it.
 If you just think of him
 – as a somewhat intense Choji… – Choji has fat on him
 for the sake of his Ninjutsu…
 I don’t have the slightest idea what purpose that prince’s fat serves.
 That’s a pretty severe opinion, you know…
 I’m going off somewhere for a moment.
 Huh? Hey, where are you going?!
 Gimme a break, that girl’s a handful…
 Well, this is for the sake of a mission after all.
 I guess it’s about time for Naruto to lend a helping hand!
 What is it?!
 I’m not judging you, but I think you should pass on that young prince.
 There’s something wrong with his head. I’m positive!
 What are you saying? He’s a passionate and wonderful man!
 But…
 I hired the Leaf to provide me with substitute for
 the arranged courtship and bring it to success.
 You’re a professional Shinobi, right?
 So I suggest you get on it and get the job done!
 The atmosphere in there hasn’t been very congenial at all!
 You need to be aggressive in making yourself appealing to him!
 I’m sorry to have kept you waiting, Chikara!
 That’s right! Just like that…huh?
 That jerk…!
 H-Hey!
 P-P-Princess?
 Master Chikara… Could you loosen my sash for me, please?
 But…but…
 Please.
 Oh my gosh!
 There’s a creepy-crawler up here under the roof that looks like a sow bug!
 Mind Destruction Jutsu!
 A creepy-crawler that looks like a sow bug?
 An insect?
 Oh…she vanished…
 What the heck are you thinking?!
 Where is the princess?
 I don’t know.
 She vanished…
 What is going on anyway?
 This is starting to irritate me… I can’t get what’s happening from here.
 Why are you meddling! I was just one step away!
 What do you think you’re doing, dressed up like Princess Fuku?!
 I’m telling you!
 In one of Pervy Sage’s books happened to glance at,
 this is the kind of thing that worked.
 I don’t believe that anyone would use such a garish advance!
 That’s dirty!
 There’s absolutely no way a type of guy like you
 would ever be mistaken for the protagonist of a boy’s comic!
 Huh! I was doing a way better job than you were!
 Gimme a break…
 Now that things have come to this,
 I need to take care of business before another meddler gets in the way!
 Huh… You gotta be kidding…
 It looks like my help is needed if this mission is going to be a success.
 Princess… where in the world have you been?
 Please forgive me. I was so nervous I just flew into a panic earlier on…
 You really seemed like a totally different person.
 I’m so sorry.
 You were such a wonderful person, that it became almost unbearable…
 Non. That is bad.
 We must change the air in here then.
 Oh, in that case, I will…
 Hi… Chikara!
 Huh?
 That just now, outside the sliding paper door…
 What’s the matter?
 There was one more…princess!
 That can’t be… Impossible.
 INNER INO 							Naruto…!
 But I’m very moved that you have such deep feelings for me
 that you actually saw a vision…
 Vision? No, I definitely saw…
 You mustn’t look!
 P-Princess?
 Damn…I did that without thinking…
 Oh goodness me…
 In my ardent desire for you to look just at me, I…
 What intense passion…
 All right… As you wish, princess.
 – Huh? 					– Allow me to catch
 those hot feelings in fine style!
 Could this be…?
 Come, don’t hold back.
 Huh?!
 You may not kiss him! No kisses!
 Oh!
 Goodness, you cannot be too careful these days!
 Who told you that you could go as far as kissing him?!
 Oh, it’s not that I wanted to…
 I’d have to say that you actually came to my rescue.
 Don’t bandy words with me!
 Listen carefully, holding hands is as much as I can concede to you…!
 You’re too loud!
 The princess vanished again.
 – Princess! 					– Princess!
 This isn’t good! I better hurry back.
 Don’t try anything funny in there!
 I know that! In any case, we can’t let him see the two of us together!
 Hurry back to your room, Princess!
 All right.
 Gimme a break that Ino…
 Dumping me in the lake like that. Thanks to her I’m freezing!
 This is bad! I gotta pee… Gotta go!
 I don’t know where the toilet is around here.
 There’s nobody around… Well, it is an emergency situation after all.
 Huh?!
 W-W-What the heck do you think you’re doing over there looking like me?!
 No…this is…um…
 How shameless! Stop that immediately!
 I can’t stop it…
 Do you not understand that I’m telling you to stop!
 It’s impossible to stop so sudden!
 Hey!
 Wait up!
 I wasn’t quite emotionally prepared earlier on…
 However, the feelings I have for you in my heart are true.
 Princess…
 Master Chikara…
 I have harbored a secret love for you for a long time.
 Please, take me…
 Huh?
 – I wonder what that sound is? – I have no idea…
 Rain?
 What a beautiful rainbow…
 Stop, I say!
 I told you, it’s impossible!
 Ouch!
 Princess?!
 Naruto!
 You idiot!
 Forgive me for this one, please!
 I won’t forgive you!
 Look what you’ve done!
 Ouch… Stop!
 What in the world is going on?!
 Oh no!… 					Umm…this is, well…
 All right, that’s enough… We can't fake it any longer.
 I apologize for having hoodwinked you. I am…the bona fide Fuku.
 You mean to say that the princess up to now was an imposter?
 That is correct.
 What is the meaning of all this?
 I wouldn’t have imagined that things would come to such a finale!
 No, that’s not correct, Master Chikara!
 Out of my way!
 The super body I fantasized about in my dreams! My ideal personified!
 Bravo!
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 My cute princess. Please marry me!
 I’m delighted, Master Chikara!
 Hail the future wife!
 What is this anyway…?
 Somehow it seems like our mission turned out to be success in the end…
 I think?
 Could it be? I put all my efforts in making advances on a guy
 who’s not my type in the least and got rejected.
 Moreover, it was a totally wasted effort…
 Is that what happened?
 But, everything turned out well. So isn’t it okay?
 And both of them look so happy together…
 That’s not the problem! A damsel’s heart has been wounded…
 I can’t believe that, of all things, I was brushed off by a guy like that…
 He didn’t even glance in your direction at the end there.
 Stop it! Don’t remind me.
 You can never knows what a person likes, can you?
 Nope… there’s no way I’ll acknowledge that!
 A man’s got to like a slender girl better!
 In order to become even more of a woman,
 I’m going on a diet! On a diet!
 Wait…wait up!
 On a checkerboard night
 when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
 I just can’t come out and say, “Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
 Suggestively
 Spat at that beloved face!! Mister Cricket
 The Trombone gradually going off-key
 While on the sweaty center stage does bug me.
 But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel in my undeveloped chest,
 I wonder if it’s from that coke I just drank?
 Naruto, let’s make some bittersweet memories of youth together!
 – Huh? 					– No need to be shy.
 I am ready both in mind and body!
 What are you blabbing about all of a sudden?!
 It was long…
 To think how much I’ve waited for this moment!
 I have no idea what you’re talking about!
 Here I come Naruto! Please become my first.
 Just a minute.
 Next Time: “Viva Dojo Challenge! Youth is all about Passion!”

31,"Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 Ugh... what are you here for now?
 It’s our reunion after so long, and you’re awfully cold.
 Don’t tell me that you came to assassinate Lord Hokage?
 No, no…
 I don’t have enough subordinates for that yet...
 I’ve heard of the excellence ones of this village
 and thought I’d put dibs on them.
 A little while ago, I gave that same Curse Mark as a present.
 There’s a kid that I want.
 Selfish as always.
 That kid will die.
 Certainly…
 The odds are 1 in 10 that he’ll survive,
 but he may survive just like you did.
 This kid, you really like him, huh?
 Are you jealous?
 Are you still holding a grudge that I used you and threw you away?
 Unlike you, that kid will excel...
 For one thing, he inherited the Uchiha ability.
 He has beautiful features
 and is a vessel who can become my heir.
 If that kid lived, it makes things interesting.
 Be sure not to cancel this test.
 Three from my village are also under your care…
 Make me enjoy it.
 If something happens to deprive me of my fun,
 consider it the end of Leaf Village.
 We’ve secured food and water after spending half a day.
 And now most teams have halted activity.
 As we planned, this is the time that we attack.
 We'll split up into three and go scouting.
 However, whether we find other teams or not,
 we return to this place.
 Got it?
 Okay.
 Roger.
 Okay. Scatter!
 Bushy-Brow’s Pledge: Undying Love and Protection!
 I can’t fall asleep...
 I need to protect these two.
 I slept great!
 Naruto!
 Sasuke!
 Did you take care of us?
 Thank you, Sakura!
 We’re totally better because of you!
 That’s good...
 A prey must always stay tense and flee desperately
 in front of the predator!
 My voice is gone!
 It was just a dream...
 Is it daybreak already?!
 No, no way!
 A squirrel?
 Don’t surprise me like that!
 Oh!
 That was too close.
 Do you think she noticed?
 The Paper Bomb we put on the squirrel...
 No, that’s not it.
 Huh? Then what? What was it?
 We’ll probably find out if we go closer.
 So... we should get going now.
 If I can catch all twenty of these leaves before they hit the ground
 Sakura will start to like me.
 If... if I can’t catch even one of the leaves...!
 It’ll be an unanswered love forever. Or rather…
 You’re too Bushy!
 That’s what she’ll say.
 One, two, three, four... five, six, seven, eight...
 nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,  fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen,
 nine--! 					Ugh, nineteen...
 One more!
 That’s…!
 Phew... just in time.
 This is called a Paper Bomb and it explodes after some time.
 Who did such an awful thing?
 Stop hiding and come out.
 Shoot! We scrambled to hide, you know?!
 Man, he’s a damn pain and we've been discovered!
 Strategy One, “hide and let it pass,” was a failure!
 So now we carry out Strategy Two!
 Huh? Are you serious?
 What? You have a problem with that?
 There’s no question of success.
 Well, I guess it’s all right but...
 Wow! To meet last year’s Number One rookie, Neji Hyuga, in a place like this!
 C-Can I have your autograph?
 So it’s just you guys?
 Take that! Strategy Two, “head over heals infatuation with my sex appeal”!
 I’d been wanting to meet you for some time, you know?
 Get lost!
 Why? Why doesn’t my sexiness work?!
 Shoot, it ticks me off, darn!
 Did you just raise your fists to me, and does that mean you want to fight?
 N-No... 					Of course not.
 Then get lost.
 Stealing a scroll from cowardly wimps  like you
 would only make me the laughing stock of the village.
 Y-Yes!
 Huh... Really just like cockroaches.
 Just as I thought.
 A fellow like that wouldn’t take a scroll away from wimps like us
 unless we were to turn on him.
 All right! Let’s go find some wimps!
 Like I’ve been saying there’s no one wimpier than us...
 So a no-sleep lookout?
 But it’s not necessary anymore.
 Wake Sasuke up. We want to battle with him.
 Y-You bastards…
 What’re you saying?
 What is it you’re after?
 I know the one called Orochimaru is calling the shots from the shadows!
 Huh?!
 What’s that strange bruise on the back of Sasuke’s neck?
 You did this to Sasuke.
 How can you say you want to fight him?!
 I wonder…what he has on his mind?
 However, I can’t stay quiet after hearing that.
 I will kill this girl, I’ll also kill this Sasuke character.
 Wait, Zaku.
 Huh? What is it?
 It’s so cliché.
 It’s the color of dirt  that’s just been dug up.
 This grass, it doesn’t grow in a place like this, does it?
 Darn!
 You know, with a trap...
 there’s no point unless you make it so it’s not discovered.
 Huh, how ridiculous!
 So that Kunai knife was so the squirrel wouldn’t be caught in the trap ?
 We kill her now!
 A log?!
 A trap above too? Watch out!
 Just kidding.
 What?!
 Clearly you have no talent.
 Someone like you needs to make more of an effort or else!
 Leaf Hurricanes!
 What?! This guy...
 Then you also should... make an effort!
 Who are you?
 I’m the beautiful blue beast of Leaf Village, Rock Lee!
 Why are you here?
 I will always appear...
 whenever you’re in trouble!
 Or should I say...
 It was really because of you, now run along.
 But right now, I’m also your enemy!
 I did say this once before, didn’t I?
 That I’ll protect you until I die.
 Please go out with me!
 I’ll protect you until I die!
 Oh...
 T-Thanks.
 Yes!
 Perfect! I did it! Gu Sensei, that was perfect!
 I guess it can’t be helped...
 Zaku. I’ll give you Sasuke.
 I will kill them!
 As far as I can tell,  Sakura is in no condition to fight.
 That Bushy-Brow guy is  pretty proficient with Taijutsu...
 Looks like I can have some fun!
 There is a trick to your attack, isn’t there?
 I won’t just simply avoid it.
 You showed me your Jutsu before.
 This guy…he’s strong.
 Having said that,
 the odds aren’t good since it’s one versus three.
 I’m gonna have to take a chance.
 One person at a time...
 I’ll give it my all and take each down!
 There’s no one at all that seems wimpy!
 Well, the only team that’s weaker than us is the Naruto team.
 Idiot! You know what you’re saying?
 What?!
 No question Naruto and Sakura are lame!
 But that team has the super genius Sasuke!
 Hah! I wonder...
 In actual battle that genius might easily be beaten.
 What?!
 All right, all right, I apologize for irritating you.
 What a pain...
 I say one negative thing about Sasuke and I get the evil eye, every time…
 There’s no way Sasuke could be taken down!
 Sakura’s a different matter though!
 Huh?!
 Hey! Sasuke has collapsed...
 Huh?!
 ...and Sakura is fighting.
 What did you say?
 Hey!
 He’s late.
 That Lee...
 Something’s not right.
 He’s always precise about time.
 Perhaps he ran into the enemy...
 Could it be...?
 Huh, that wouldn’t have happened.
 In any case, let’s find Lee!
 Right!
 Yes! I’ve finally mastered it! Yes! Yes!
 My friends, there’s no reason to give up on your youth!
 This Jutsu...
 In the end, only Lee  could make it his own.
 Yahoo!
 – Hey Lee... – I did it! I will do it!
 – Lee! 					– When I try! I try!
 Hey, Lee!
 Hey!
 Listen to this passionate message from your teacher!
 Oh... what is it?!
 Please tell me using hip words.
 This Jutsu, the “Lotus”...
 it will be dealt with henceforth as a forbidden Jutsu.
 – What?! 					– Huh?!
 W-What do you mean?
 This Jutsu poses a great burden on the cells of the muscles,
 it’s a kind of “Self-sacrificing Technique.”
 Humans normally utilize, at most, 20 percent...
 of the “power” that the muscles have.
 Do you understand? Only 20 percent!
 And if nearly 100 percent of the “power” is used
 the muscles themselves will disintegrate.
 So, the brain usually controls the “power.”
 However, this Jutsu forces the brain’s limiter to go off by using Chakra,
 allowing high speed continuous Taijutsu...
 In other words, this is a dangerous Jutsu which relies on a secret technique
 that brings forth “power” almost  to the limit of one’s body.
 So the only time it is all right to use this Jutsu
 is when a certain condition is met...
 So... when is that?
 Take this to heart...
 The condition is
 Guy Sensei...
 I will utilize that Jutsu without reserve.
 Because this is the time you said...
 ""When protecting a previous person!""
 He disappeared?!
 Oh, oh no!
 There's no way he can break his fall!
 Take this!
 Primary Lotus!
 This feeling...
 Well well...
 Just in time.
 T-That's impossible!
 That is a frightening Jutsu...
 It did this much even though I fell on the spongy dirt.
 It's now my turn.
 Oh no!
 With what I just did...
 Lee!
 Your Jutsu is indeed fast.
 But our Jutsu exceeds that
 and is the speed of sound!
 I'll show you there are walls
 which effort alone can never break through.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 I'm so frustrated!
 I'm just pulling feet again.
 I'm always just being protected.
 I always just watch them from behind.
 This time, I need to protect everyone!
 Naruto, Sasuke, Lee!
 I want to be like you too!
