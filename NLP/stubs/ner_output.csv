 Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
 One more time
 Are you really happy
 when you're always meeting to someone's expectations?
 Even if you change to who you really wanna be
 Will you always have a great smile?
 Dreaming of only “the beginning,” I wake up
 and someday, I'll live on my own.
 Yes, precious things are never in shape
 You never know what it is when you get it or lose it
 Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
 Even if you get lost, let's start walking
 One more time
 The rules are the same as in the preliminaries.
 The match goes on until one of you dies or admits defeat.
 When it’s determined that there’s a winner,
 the match can be stopped.
 But that’s my decision.
 Bushy Brow's Jutsu: Sasuke Style!
 Hey Guy! You too, Lee…
 Is your body all right?
 Kakashi!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Oh! Sorry, sorry.
 You must’ve been worried. Sorry for not contacting you at all…
 Oh no, Sakura’s gonna get really mad…
 I don’t really mind that.
 It's hard to see from here…
 Sasuke…
 Kakashi Sensei…
 Hm?
 You know about the mark on Sasuke’s neck, don’t you?
 Is that…?
 No need to worry.
 A mark?
 So, that’s that.
 Yup!
 One…
 Two…
 Three…
 Four…
 Five…
 Six…
 Seven…
 Eight.
 Eight of them…
 There are eight members of Anbu Black Ops in this spacious arena…
 Two platoons are too few…
 What’s Lord Hokage thinking?
 Well…without knowing how or when the opponent would make their move…
 It can’t be helped that the Anbu are dispersed and deployed
 in important areas in the village.
 Huh?
 It’s about to begin.
 We shouldn’t let our guard down, but for now…
 We need to pay attention…  to this match.
 Kakashi, I’ll be carefully checking out what sort of training you gave him…
 as your eternal rival!
 Huh? Did you say something?
 No! You’re slick, Kakashi!
 Why are you always so avant-garde?!
 Both of you, to the middle!
 Begin!
 So this is the sand Kakashi told me about…
 Please don’t get so mad…
 Mother…
 What’s he talking about…?
 Earlier… Earlier I had you suck awful-tasting blood.
 I’m sorry.
 But this time it’ll likely…
 taste good.
 His conversation’s started. This is dangerous.
 This is the first time I’ve seen Gaara get like that before fighting.
 So it must mean his opponent is that imposing…
 Him.
 It appears he’s calmed down.
 Come on.
 Hey…
 Do you remember… what he said yesterday?
 At that time…
 I will kill…you all without fail.
 Just wait.
 That’s what he said…
 But he didn’t do it.
 It was the perfect opportunity, but…
 he didn’t even see us.
 Now, let me feel it!
 We're…
 unsatisfactory for him.
 Right now, the only one who can make him feel anything…
 …is only Sasuke!
 I live fighting for only myself and loving myself…
 And if I see that all other people in this world
 exist only to make me realize that,
 there could be no world more wonderful.
 Naruto…
 Here we go!
 The Sand Shield became a Sand Clone!
 He’s fast! This guy… is just like that guy…
 He’s fast! It’s nearly the same as Lee’s ordinary speed.
 And…
 It's overlapping with the image…
 of my Taijutsu!
 Is that the Sand Armor?
 Come on!
 Thank you, Anbu man.
 So apparently, Hinata will be all right for now if she rests.
 Oh, is that right?
 Huh? You know this person? What‘re you taking about?
 This person is an Anbu…
 Not that, but at the examination…? What do you mean?
 Well, this is what it means…
 Come on!
 If you’re not gonna come at me, I’ll go at you!
 He’s fast!
 What’s the matter? Is that it?
 A-Amazing…
 That armor…I’ll tear it off.
 His speed is basically the same as Lee’s with the weights removed.
 It’s… It’s exactly like Lee’s Taijutsu.
 His speed is also completely different from before!
 Sasuke… You are indeed a genius beyond imagination.
 How many years did it take me to attain that speed…?
 And you attained it in a mere month…!
 However, it seems to consume a lot of stamina
 to continue that movement.
 What’s Gaara planning to do?
 The sand armor uses up too much Chakra…
 It can’t last for very long.
 What the heck sort of training did you do?!
 Hm?
 To get to that level in a mere month…
 Sasuke had copied Lee’s Taijutsu with Sharingan.
 So during the Taijutsu training…
 I had Sasuke image Lee’s movements.
 Sasuke could make that movement his own
 only because he knew Lee.
 Of course, Sasuke had to work very hard for it.
 But…with only that…
 With only Taijutsu… that Sand guy can’t be taken down!
 That Kakashi…
 He must have seen the battle
 between the hateful Gaara and the lovable Lee.
 Taijutsu that was taught suddenly
 can’t work against an opponent that even Lee couldn’t take down.
 He should have known this only to well.
 So if that’s the case…
 Why is it that he had Sasuke master only Taijutsu?!
 Why did I keep living?
 But as long as you’re alive, you need a reason…
 If you don’t have one, it’s just the same as being dead.
 What's this guy saying?!
 So this is the answer I came to…
 I am living in order to kill human beings other than myself.
 After living in the fear of never knowing when I might be murdered,
 finally, I became calm.
 Oh?
 Shikamaru…
 We need to go over to where Kakashi Sensei is right now!
 What’re you planning to do?
 Hey!
 I'm going to…
 stop this match!
 Gaara couldn’t possibly be planning to use that Jutsu!
 So he used all the sand for protection…
 I didn’t think there could be this much of a difference in the hardness
 with a difference in the density of the sand.
 So it’s absolute protection.
 The sand… lt’s covered his entire body.
 This is somewhat troublesome.
 Now, how will Sasuke proceed?!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Naruto!
 Huh? What do you want?
 Sensei! Please stop this match right away!
 That guy is totally different from us!
 He’s not normal!
 Naruto… 					What’re you saying?
 He lives to kill people.
 In any case…
 If this continues, Sasuke will die!
 Jin, Saru,
 Ne, Saru, Tori, Tatsu, Ne, Saru…
 There’s no mistake about it. lt’s that Jutsu!
 This isn’t good! Our plan isn’t even on Gaara’s mind.
 Shoot!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Everyone makes mistakes lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Yes, breathe in the air Lift your face to the sky and jump
 If it rains, take a break Go where the wind takes you
 So many regrets Don’t let this scar be for naught
 Let’s go carve the badges in our chest Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.
 Everyone makes mistakes lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Transform sadness into the wind and continue to forge on
 Forge on strong
 Sasuke, when I fought you once, I said
 Even if one understands visually,
 it's meaninless unless one can move physically.
 I was filled with a sense of superiority.
 But now, you have a body that moves at the same high speed as mine.
 Moreover, you have…Sharingan!
 Next time, “Late for the Show, But Ready to Go! 		The Ultimate Secret Technique is Born!”
 I am really envious of you, Sasuke!

1,"A long time ago, a powerful demon fox appeared with nine tails.
 With its powerful tails,
 it could smash mountains and create tidal waves.
 A band of Ninjas rose to defend their village from attack.
 We have to wait until the Fourth Hokage gets here!
 We can't let it get any closer to our village!
 One great Ninja was able to imprison the monster,
 but died in the process.
 This Ninja was known as… the Fourth Hokage.
 Naruto!
 Why did you do such a thing?!
 You're really gonna get it this time!
 I don't care!
 You know your problem?
 You can't do the things I do!
 Only I can do this!
 I'm better than all of you! Believe it!
 There's a problem, sir!
 Lord Hokage!
 What is it?
 Did that Naruto do something again?
 Yes. He climbed onto the Mountainside Images…
 And he vandalized and graffitied all over them!
 Wait!
 Ha ha…
 Why should I?
 Hey, Naruto!
 How did you suddenly get here, lruka Sensei?
 The question is what are you doing here when you should be in class now?
 Now listen, Naruto.
 You failed the last graduation test and the one before that.
 This is no time to be goofing off, you fool!
 We will have a re-test on the Transformation Jutsu!
 Even those who already passed will take it!
 Whaaaat?!
 Sakura Haruno. Here I go…
 Transform!
 OK!
 I did it!
 Cha!
 Did you see that, Sasuke?
 Next, Sasuke Uchiha.
 Yes.
 O-OK.
 Next, Naruto Uzumaki.
 This is a real pain.
 And it's all your fault.
 Like I care!!
 OK…
 Good luck, Naruto…
 Transform!
 How was it?
 I call it the ""Sexy Jutsu""!
 You fool! Stop making idiotic spells!
 Darn…
 Darn…
 I won't let you go home unless you clean that all up.
 I don't care…
 There's nobody home anyway.
 Naruto...
 What is it this time?
 What I meant was…
 If you clean up all that mess, I'll buy you ramen tonight.
 Huh?!
 Yes! I-I will finish it no time!
 Enter: Naruto Uzumaki!
 Naruto.
 Why did you vandalize those faces?
 Don't you know who the Hokage leaders are?
 Of course, I do!
 I know they earned the title Lord Hokage
 because they were the best Ninja of their time, right?
 Especially the Fourth Hokage was a hero
 who saved the village from the nine-tail demon fox.
 Then why did you do that?
 Because I'll become a Hokage myself.
 And I'll be the greatest Hokage of all time!
 So that everyone will finally learn to accept me!
 By the way, Sensei, I have a favor to ask.
 You want another bowl?
 Mmmm…No…
 Can I borrow that Leaf headband for a while?
 This?
 No no!
 This is worn only by those who have graduated from Ninja Academy.
 Tomorrow, you will…
 You're so mean!
 So that's why you took off your goggles…
 Humph... One more bowl please!
 We are now about to begin the graduation test.
 When your name is called, proceed to the next classroom.
 The test is on the Clone Jutsu.
 Oh no…
 Of all the…! That is my weakest Jutsu!
 But still… I will do it no matter what!
 Clone Jutsu!
 Disqualified!
 Iruka Sensei.
 His physical coordination and stamina are excellent.
 And he managed to come up with something.
 Isn't that enough for him to pass?
 Mizuki Sensei... All the others created three or more clones.
 Naruto created just one.
 And it's practically useless. I can't give him a passing mark.
 I 'm a Ninja now!
 You did well. That's my son.
 Congratulations for your graduation.
 I'll cook something good tonight!
 Look at that one.
 It's that boy. I hear he's the only one who failed.
 Serves him right.
 Imagine what would happen if he became a Ninja.
 Isn't that the boy who is actually…
 Hey! We're not supposed to talk about that.
 Iruka. We need to talk later.
 Yes, sir.
 Iruka Sensei isn't trying to be mean to you.
 Then why only me?
 He wants you to become strong from the bottom of his heart.
 You both don't have parents.
 But I really wanted to graduate.
 Heh... I guess I have no choice…
 I'll let you in on a big secret.
 Secret?
 Iruka.
 What is it, Lord Hokage?
 I know how you feel. But…
 Naruto also grew up without knowing the love of his parents…like you.
 Let me go!
 My mom and dad are still out there fighting!
 Wake up, Iruka Sensei!
 What's the matter?
 Come to Lord Hokage's immediately!
 I heard that Naruto… stole the Scroll of Sealing.
 The Scroll of Sealing?!
 Let's see…
 The first Jutsu is… Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu?
 What?! Already a Jutsu I'm no good at?
 Lord Hokage! We can't forgive him!
 This is not just a prank!
 The Scroll is a dangerous item that the First Hokage sealed!
 Depending on its use…
 It will be a major disaster if it is taken out of the village!
 Yes. Bring Naruto here at once!
 Yes, sir!
 Where did you go…Naruto?
 I will tell everyone in the village about this and eliminate Naruto…
 Then the Scroll of Sealing will be mine!
 Hey you, Naruto!
 You found me..
 And I've only learned one Jutsu.
 He's been practicing the Jutsu…
 until he's become this exhausted and dirty…?
 Listen, listen! I'm gonna show you this amazing Jutsu!
 You're gonna let me graduate if I can do it!
 Isn't it true that I can graduate if I can do one of the Jutsu written here?
 Who told you that?
 Mizuki Sensei. He told me about this scroll, and this place…
 Mizuki did?!
 I'm impressed you found this place.
 I see now…how it is.
 Naruto, give me that scroll.
 Wait, wait… What's going on here?
 Naruto! Never give him that scroll!
 It is a dangerous object that contains forbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed.
 Mizuki used you in order to get it for himself!
 W-Wha--?
 Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of you holding that scroll!
 Huh?
 What are you saying, Mizuki! Don't let him fool you, Naruto!
 I will tell you the truth.
 Idiot! Don't do that!
 After an incident 12 years ago, a rule was created.
 A rule?
 That is, Naruto, a rule everybody but you knows.
 Except me?! 					What is it?
 Stop it, Mizuki!
 The rule forbids anyone from revealing that you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit!
 Huh?
 You are actually the Demon, Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,
 who killed Iruka's parents and destroyed our village!
 Stop it!
 Everyone has been deceiving you ever since.
 Didn't you find it strange?
 Why everyone hated you so much?
 No! No! No! No! No!
 Naruto…
 Nobody accepts you. That's why Iruka hates you so much!
 Iruka... Naruto grew up without the love of parents.
 Everyone avoids him like the plague after what happened.
 That's why he keeps misbehaving.
 It's the only way for him to get any attention or acknowledgement.
 He pretends to be tough, but inside he is really hurting.
 Die, Naruto!
 Naruto! 					Get down!
 Why…?
 Because you and I are the same.
 After my parents died,
 nobody paid attention to me or gave me any support.
 I wasn't a good student in school.
 I was the class clown… because I wanted people to notice me.
 I couldn't get noticed through excellence, so I kept doing stupid things.
 It was so hard.
 Isn't that right, Naruto?
 You felt so lonely…right? And you suffered inside, right?
 I'm sorry, Naruto….
 If I had been more responsible, maybe you wouldn't have suffered so much.
 Don't make me laugh!
 Iruka has always hated you, ever since you killed his parents!
 He's just saying all that to get the Scroll of Sealing back!
 Naruto!
 Narutoooooo!
 He is not the type of kid who will change his mind.
 He will take revenge against our village using that scroll!
 Didn't you see his eyes? Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox.
 No… Naruto…isn't…like that at all!
 All I want is to kill Naruto and get the scroll.
 I'll take care of you later!
 I-I won't let you…
 Well, well.
 Mizuki has a big mouth!
 Naruto feels worse than he's ever felt.
 He might unleash the power locked up inside him.
 The Scroll of Sealing is now with him.
 There's a slight chance he might actually release
 the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit sealed inside him!
 If that happens…
 I've found him!
 Naruto!
 Everything that Mizuki said was a lie!
 Give me that scroll, quick! Mizuki is after the scroll!
 It can't be…
 Why is it, Naruto?
 How…
 did you know I wasn't Iruka…?
 Because I'm Iruka.
 I see.
 What's in it for you to protect the one who killed your family?
 I'm not gonna let a stupid idiot like you get that scroll!
 You're the idiot. Naruto is the same as me.
 Same?
 Anyone can do whatever he wants once he has the scroll.
 There is no way that that monster…
 that Fox Spirit, won't take advantage of the power of that scroll!
 You're right…
 I guess it was true all along!
 See, Iruka Sensei never really cared for me at all!
 ...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit.
 But Naruto is different!
 I know that he is an exceptional student.
 He works very hard,
 and he's single-minded and clumsy at the same time.
 No one accepts him, but he knows the meaning of human suffering.
 He is not the Demon Fox Spirit.
 He's Naruto Uzumaki of the Village Hidden in the Leaves!
 You are so gullible. 					lruka!
 I was gonna take you down later, but I have changed my mind.
 Die!
 I guess this is the end for me…
 Naruto?!
 You surprised me there, freak.
 If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I'll kill you!
 Shut up! I can take care of a kid like you with a single blow!
 Why don't you try then? I'll strike you back a thousand-fold!
 Let's see you try! Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Naruto! You've…
 Those aren't just images but actual clones! That's an advanced Ninjutsu!
 What's this…?
 What's the matter? 					C'mon!
 Weren't you gonna get me with one blow? Here!
 In that case… I'll come to you.
 I kinda got carried away. lruka Sensei, are you okay?
 Yeah.
 He's really something.
 Maybe it is true.
 Maybe he will surpass all the Hokage leaders…
 Naruto, come over here. I'd like to give you something.
 Has anyone found Naruto yet?
 No.
 Darn, this is going to be bad…
 There's no need to worry anymore.
 Lord Hokage!
 He'll be back soon.
 Sensei, how much longer?
 OK, you may open your eyes now.
 Congratulations…on your graduation.
 In celebration, we'll have ramen tonight!
 Iruka Sensei!
 That hurts!
 Naruto…
 I was going to lecture to you...
 that the road gets more difficult now that you're a Ninja.
 But I guess I'll just wait to tell you that until we get to the ramen stand…
 W-What do you want, you little shrimp? Quit following me!
 You're smaller than me and
 you're saying that you're gonna become the Fifth Hokage?
 I don't care if you are the 3rd Hokage's grandson or not.
 It's not that easy to be a Hokage!
 If you want it that bad, you're gonna have to beat me first!
 Next episode:  ""My Name Is Konohamaru!""
 Watch my outstanding performance!

 Fujin and Raijin.
 Fujin…and Raijin?
 Yeah. They’re a little weak upstairs, but their brute strength…
 is Herculean, surpassing even that of the Legendary Sannin.
 Are you serious?
 Damn… It looks like he really means it.
 Pretty amazing that they are able to hold out
 against the Shadow Possession Jutsu only by using their strength…
 It looks like this is gonna turn into a troublesome situation again…
 Leave this to us… You go pursue Mizuki!
 We’ll be fine!
 Leave it to us!
 Awright!
 But be careful!
 Those guys are crazy like monsters!
 Yeah… I can see that.

 Thanks, guys!
 We better hurry, Naruto!

 D-Damn!
 This is Genjutsu…
 Release!
 After Genjutsu… Puppets come, huh?
 His Jutsu are diverse.
 And moreover, the timing of his Jutsu are superb…
 I was really close to   being taken down…
 I wouldn’t have imagined that
 he could have such full command of the high level Jutsu…that Mizuki.
 I guess I can praise you on catching that the Puppet was real.
 However… I wonder how long
 you’re gonna be able to continue to engage in my game, Iruka!
 Where’s this…?!
 This ain’t good…
 They’re able to repel Shadow Possession Jutsu
 using only their strength…
 Shikamaru, I’ll go!

 Elder Brother! What’s the matter, Elder Brother?!
 Iruka Sensei… I’ll catch up with you in no time…
 Please be safe!
 How do you like my Jutsu, Iruka?
 Pretty good for being self-taught, wouldn’t you say?
 I can’t understand…
 You have the ability to use such high-level Ninjutsu to this degree…
 why would you waste it?!
 As always, trying to impose your morals on me, huh…?!
 You’re so lukewarm! You’re so naïve!
 Don’t you start preaching me!
 I won’t acknowledge you, no matter what!
 I consistently hardened my heart and carried out my missions…
 Despite that, those guys in the village…
 No matter how strong I was!
 No matter how many enemies I took down in my missions!
 Those guys didn’t even attempt to acknowledge me!
 Saying we’re comrades, it’s all about teamwork…
 They were all bound by stupid rules!
 His target’s the Secret Manuscript.
 Backup Mizuki!
 Right!
 Hey! Are you all right?!
 I-I can’t feel my leg…
 What do you think, Mizuki?
 It’s no good. lt’s unfortunate, but he can no longer…
 I see…
 All right! Let’s withdraw!
 Hurry!
 Yeah…
 It’s unfortunate, but…
 Guys who are of no use on the battleground
 only become a ball and chain…
 Even though it’s just a minor injury,
 you won’t be able to move from this place…
 If you’re wanna blame someone,
 I suggest you blame your own helpless self!
 I simply carried out my mission faithfully.
 And despite that, those guys in the village…
 Not one of them even attempted to acknowledge me…
 Why?! Why didn’t anybody acknowledge my strength?!
 Why?! Iruka…!
 When you and even that Nine-Tailed brat are acknowledged, why only me…?
 It’s still not too late.
 If you pay for your crimes and start afresh,
 the people in the village will certainly…
 How cocky! Don’t preach to me!
 You’re just the same as those other guys in the village!
 You disdain me, don’t you?!
 Mizuki…
 Everything…
 That’s right… Everything began that day…
 What are you gonna do, getting nervous now?
 Mizuki…
 It finally takes place tomorrow, doesn’t it?
 The Academy’s teacher recruitment exam…
 Yeah… It’s weighing heavily on me.
 I’m envious of you. Your scores are better than mine.
 You’ll breeze right through tomorrow’s exam.
 Not quite… Well, in any case, let’s both do our best!
 Yeah!
 Damn!
 Lie low!
 That was close, Iruka!
 Yeah…
 Mizuki… Thank you. You really helped me out!
 It’s mutual… Come on, let’s hurry!

 Now then, regarding Mizuki… we will adopt a wait-and-see attitude.
 Yes, it can’t be helped.
 I agree… The questions that were raised
 at the time of that mission to recover the Secret Manuscript…
 Until those are completely cleared up… lt can’t be helped, can it?
 According to the autopsy report…
 the cause of death to that corpse was given as suffocation.
 In Mizuki and the others’ reports,
 it stated that the leg injury was not that serious…
 I understand…
 He’s brilliant but it can’t be helped.
 I was just carrying out the mission that I was assigned to do!
 Can you understand how miserable the life I've led has been since then?!
 Huh? Iruka?!
 You have no idea, do you?
 I have undergone so many hardships,
 and you, who has had it so easy…
 Which one of us is the true Shinobi…
 Let’s clarify that once and for all, shall we?!
 Now then come! Iruka!
 Mizuki… Where are you?!
 You don’t have any intention of reforming yourself, do you?!
 Don’t make me say the same thing over and over again!
 Then I’ll bring this to an end now…
 It’s very unfortunate, though!
 What a tearjerker…
 It makes me happy too, Iruka…
 Elder Brother?! What’s the matter, Elder Brother?!
 Hey… You came back, Elder Brother!
 Uh, Elder Brother?
 What did you guys do to… to Elder Brother?!
 I hijacked him! Idiot!
 Wh-What the heck…?!
 What?!
 Elder Brother! Get up! Wake up!
 These guys!
 Owww…!
 Are you okay, Ino?
 I-I think I’m…
 not okay! My gorgeous face is…!
 Good grief… Gimme a break…
 C-Choji!
 Choji!
 Are you okay?!
 I-I’m fine…
 Sorry… Feels like I fell asleep a little.
 Hey, Elder Brother… You woke up.
 Damn. Can’t be helped…
 Guess I have no choice but to use that thing.
 Shadow Strangle Jutsu!
 Elder Brother…!
 H-How dare you!
 We’re close. Mizuki may have set a trap so be careful!
 I know that!
 It was so much fun to be behind bars…
 The moldiness… The dampness… The gloominess…
 Pitch black year round!
 But for that very reason that I was able master techniques
 that an ordinary Shinobi would not be able to possess…
 Even in this darkness…
 I can get an intense sense of your energy…
 What’s the matter? Are you done already?
 There’s no time to be spaced out, Iruka.
 I’m gonna take my time and have fun with this…
 Take my time, got it?
 All right! Me too!
 Wait! If you go in there right now using Mind Transfer Jutsu,
 my Jutsu will affect you too!
 If you think you’re the only one who’s learned a new Jutsu,
 you’re very wrong!
 Ninja Art:
 Mind Destruction Jutsu!
 Wh-What’s the matter, Raijin?!
 R-Raijin… What are you doing?!
 Heh… Not bad…
 “Ino collection,” my new spring season Jutsu!
 We’re close!
 That’s it! That building!
 All right! Just one last spurt!
 How about it? Have your eyes adjusted a little?
 For guys like you who have lived their lives in the light,
 darkness is an inconvenience, isn’t it?
 Damn! Where are you?!
 Hey, Iruka, weren’t you saying that
 you were going to bring this to an end ?
 I see! By end,
 you must have been talking about yourself, huh?!
 Heh! Just a little bit!
 Hang in there, Ino!
 Leave it to me!
 Damn…!
 Damn! Unbelievable idiot strength!
 Th-Those jerks…
 I-I can’t hold them any longer!
 If we put a stop to the Jutsu right now, everything will go to waste…
 Think… Think about the next move…
 Bear with it, Ino!
 Leave it to me!
 You’re just gonna be sent flying again!
 Ino, just be quiet and watch!
 Even the big-boned guy can make quite a showing once he decides to do it!
 Partial Expansion Jutsu!
 Both Hands!
 Choji…
 I can’t let just Ino get all the good parts!
 I’m the number one handsome Big-Boned Ninja!
 Good work, Choji! You’re so cool!
 Huh… That Choji…
 New Formation! lno-Shika-Cho completed!
 It’s strange…
 Any hint of Mizuki in the air has vanished…
 It’s too quiet…
 That’s not it…
 Even deeper…
 Footsteps? No… It’s not …
 It’s different from the sound of footsteps…
 Finer and smaller…
 Continuous…
 sound.
 Paper Bombs?!
 Wh-What is that…?!
 Wh-What happened here?!
 Iruka Sensei?!
 Iruka Sensei!
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you don’t answer
 You’re crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   I’m crying too
 “Let my lonely scream ring out through the night”
 I’ll thrash this confused era with my speed   Yeah
 And I’ll thrash this confused night with my speed   Yeah
 I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar and my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards, I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
 No way! What happened to lruka Sensei?!
 The scent ends here.
 In any case, we just have to search the perimeter.
 Everything is in pieces. Damn it!
 Please be safe, Iruka Sensei!
 Hush! Be quiet, Naruto!
 We have a company.
 It seems someone is after us.

37,"Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 If “Heaven” does not exist,
 enrich your knowledge, and prepare for the chance.
 If “Earth” does not exist,
 run the fields in search of an advantage.
 Open the series of Heaven and Earth, and the perilous way shall be redressed…
 This is namely the secret of “the one that guides…”
 What’s that?
 It probably has to do with the scroll.
 I think this means we’re supposed to open the Heaven & Earth scroll.
 Okay then, I’m going to open it.
 Huh? What’s this?
 A man…?
 A person…?
 This is…a Summoning Jutsu!
 Naruto! Sakura! Let go of the scroll!
 Oh...
 Wha--?!
 Y-You…
 Hi!
 It’s been a long time.
 Surviving the Cut! The Rookie Nine Together Again!
 W-What’s going on?
 It appears you guys have had a rough time of it.
 What?!
 Why are you appearing with a Summoning?
 At the end of this second exam,
 we Chunin are to welcome the test-takers.
 I just happened to be given
 the important task of being the messenger for you guys.
 Messenger…?!
 Just in time.
 Everyone…
 Congratulations on surviving the second exam.
 To celebrate your passing,
 I’d like to treat you to some Ichiraku ramen, but…
 Ohh... Cool!
 Uh-oh…
 H-Hey, Naruto!
 – Listen to the end… – Cool! Cool!
 Ramen! Ramen! 					Believe it!
 I’ve done great job! I’m the greatest!
 I so want to eat ramen! Believe it!
 He’s got so much energy.
 Yaaaay!
 Shut up!
 Man, that scatterbrained part of you is the same as always, eh.
 I see.
 Huh?
 If we had looked at the scroll in the middle of the exam,
 what were you going to do, Iruka Sensei?
 Sasuke, you’re a sharp one, as usual.
 You guessed right.
 The rules of this exam were to test your conclusive mission execution ability.
 To put it simply,
 in the case of the scrolls being opened contrary to the rules…
 In the case of them being opened…?
 I was ordered to knock unconscious the test-takers in front of me
 until the end of the exam.
 Good thing you didn’t open the scroll.
 Kabuto, thank you!
 Phew!
 That was seriously close…
 Oh yeah, Sensei!
 Huh?
 By the way, what’re the letters on that wall?
 They’re kind of vermiculated and
 we don’t understand their meaning at all.
 Never mind, never mind!
 We passed!
 No…explaining that is one more of my duties.
 What, really?
 I’m saying that’s right.
 Give it a read.
 These are Chunin instructions Master Hokage recorded.
 Instructions?!
 That’s right!
 Heaven in this text refers to the human head.
 Earth refers to the human body.
 No kidding…
 If “Heaven” does not exist,
 enrich your knowledge, and prepare for the chance.
 In other words…
 If your weaknesses are inside your head, Naruto…
 learn various logics in preparing for your missions.
 Hah! So meddlesome!
 If “Earth” does not exist,
 run through the fields in search of an advantage.
 If your weaknesses are in your physical strength, Sakura,
 it means you must not slack off on your daily training.
 And if you combine both Heaven and Earth…
 Any perilous mission is the right way…
 In other words…
 what can also be called a rule of might and become a safe mission.
 Then, what about the spot with the missing letter?
 The letter refers to Chunin.
 The one letter for “person” that was in the scroll from earlier goes there.
 These five days of survival were to test
 the test-takers’ fundamental abilities as Chunin.
 And you guys cleared it in fine style.
 Chunin is of unit-leader class.
 They have the responsibility of leading a team.
 Be more deeply aware of the necessity of physical strength…
 and knowledge in missions!
 I want you to take on the next step,
 never forgetting these Chunin instructions.
 That is all of the messenger task I was given.
 Got it!
 Huh?
 But, as for the final third exam, don’t push it too far.
 Especially you, Naruto.
 – You’re the biggest worry… – Iruka Sensei.
 From when I received the Leaf headband,
 I was no longer an Academy student, you know?!
 There’s nothing to worry! Believe it!
 Also, this is the proof you gave me that I’m full-fledged, right?!
 That I’m scatterbrained may not have changed,
 but I’m not a kid anymore!
 I'm now...
 A Ninja!
 I see.
 I’m sorry, Naruto.
 I know their strength the best.
 If it’s futile anyway,
 I would like to give them the final word personally.
 If you’re that hung up on it, I can leave that team to you.
 To think you’d play the devil’s advocate…
 Thank you very much.
 But, they’re Kakashi’s, right?
 If he’s the one who recommended them,
 I thought I could count on them.
 Stay out of it!
 They’re not your students anymore. They’re my subordinates now.
 The one who might truly understand
 the strength of these kids. might be you, Kakashi.
 How is it?
 Does the Curse Mark still hurt?
 No.
 Thanks to you, it’s gotten quite a bit better.
 Anyway, Orochimaru is one of those three legendary Leaf Ninjas, right?
 He’s a S-rank bingo book rouge Shinobi
 who even the Anbu couldn’t touch, right?
 I heard that he’d already died, but…
 Why’d he come to this village now…?
 There’s a kid I want, you see.
 This kid inherits the abilities of the Uchiha clan, so…
 It's...
 It’s probably Sasuke, right?
 Huh?!
 Master Anko!
 Twenty-one second exam finishers have been confirmed.
 As for the third exam, according to the regulations of the Chunin Exams,
 preliminaries are planned for the first time in five years.
 The second exam is over.
 For the time being, continue the exams as is,
 but while keeping an eye on his movements.
 Yes…
 First off, congratulations on finishing the second exam.
 There were seventy-eight test-takers for the second exam.
 To think twenty-one have made it this far.
 I said to make it less than half, but I’d really thought about single digits.
 I’m hungry!
 There are still this many remaining?
 This is such a major pain.
 Sasuke and others have passed, too.
 Of course…
 We went to that much trouble to save them…
 It’d all be for naught if they didn’t pass.
 Your team didn’t do too bad.
 I guess they were lucky.
 But as long as my team is around, they can’t go any higher.
 After all, whether you like it or not,
 ability talks at the next barrier.
 Well, adolescence can sometimes be bittersweet and
 can sometimes be harsh, Kakashi…
 Did you say something?
 Oh my God!
 Not bad, my rival Kakashi.
 But that part of you is so hip... which is what annoys me!
 So that’s Guy Sensei’s eternal rival, eh?
 Guy Sensei totally loses visually…
 Guy Sensei is the hippest of all the teachers!
 He shines!
 Okay!
 Please watch, Guy Sensei! I’ll shine, too!
 I don’t ever want to see tears of those dear to me again.
 So…
 I won’t ever lose again!
 Guy Sensei.
 Sure enough, the outstanding candidates have gathered.
 Sasuke Uchiha, eh?
 I’ll get you back for my arms, Sasuke Uchiha…
 At any cost.
 To think a mere seven teams are left of the twenty-six…
 Sure enough, Gaara is unhurt.
 Akamaru’s acting strange…
 Those Sand Village guys…
 Naruto passed, too.
 Thank goodness…
 What, all the Leaf Village rookies are here.
 Say! Say!
 Old man Hokage and Iruka Sensei and even Intense-Brow are here. Believe it!
 It feels like everyone’s assembled.
 Humph…I don’t have a very good feeling.
 To think this many are left…
 Moreover, of those left, almost all are rookies…
 So that’s why they fought  in recommending them.
 Now then, we will now have the explanation of the third exam
 from Master Hokage.
 Listen carefully, everybody!
 Now then, if you will, Master Hokage.
 All right.
 Before the explanation of the third exam that we will start from now,
 I have just one thing I want to tell everyone flat out.
 About the true purpose of these exams.
 True purpose…?!
 Why do allied nations conduct the exams on a conjoint basis?
 Huh?
 Raising the levels of the shinobi and friendship among allied nations.
 It won’t do to have the wrong idea of the true meaning of that statement.
 These exams are so to speak…
 So to speak…?
 A microcosm of battle between allied nations.
 What does that mean?
 If we look back on history,
 the allied nations of today were once neighboring nations
 that continued to vie with each other and battle for power.
 In order to avoid a futile crushing of each others’ military strength,
 those nations mutually selected a place to battle.
 And that was how the Chunin Exams originally began.
 W-Why do we have to do such a thing?
 We’re not doing this to select Chunins?!
 There is no question that these exams are to select Shinobi
 worthy of becoming Chunin.
 But on the other hand,
 these exams also provide a venue
 for Shinobi who carry their nation’s pride on their backs to fight for their lives!
 Nation’s pride…?
 Many feudal lords and those of prominence from many nations
 who request Shinobi for work are invited to this third exam as guests.
 And, the feudal lords and Head Ninja of each Village
 of the nations will watch your battles.
 If the gap in national power becomes unbridgeable,
 the strong nations are inundated with job requests.
 The requests of nations deemed weak, on the other hand, decline.
 And therewithal,
 we can exert pressure upon each neighboring nation...
 That is to say, just how much military strength our Village is developing and has.
 Even so, why is it necessary for us to fight for our lives?!
 The nation’s strength is the Village’s strength.
 The Village’s strength is the Shinobi’s strength.
 And the true strength of the Shinobi is created only in a fight for one’s life!
 This exam is a place to see the strength of home country Shinobi,
 and a place to display this as well.
 It is because it’s an exam where you truly fight for your life
 that this has meaning.
 It’s for this very reason that your forerunners fought in this exam,
 a dream worth striving for.
 Then why… use the expression “friendship”?!
 I said it at the start, didn’t I?!
 That it won’t do for you to have the wrong idea of the meaning!
 It’s a custom where balance is preserved by fighting and removing life.
 This is the friendship of the Shinobi world.
 This is a fight for life with the pride of the village and
 one’s own dream on the line.
 Heh, I’m convinced.
 Anything is fine.
 Just tell us the content of that fight-for-life test.
 Very well.
 Now then, this is where I’d like to explain the third exam.
 But actually…
 Master Hokage, please allow me, Hayate Gekko,
 who was given the task of judge,  to speak first.
 I leave it to you…
 Nice to meet you, everyone…
 Umm, there’s something… I'd like you all to do...
 before the third exam.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 What's the idea? Sudden preliminaries?
 Didn't we just get to the tower? Also, something's wrong with Sasuke.
 It's too much for you, Sasuke! Please, drop out!
 You're in no condition to fight properly!
 No matter what you say,
 I'm going to tell the teachers about that bruise.
 Next episode: ""Narrowing the Field: Sudden Death Elimination!""
 Sasuke, I'm scared.

 because we were always together

 Hey kids, get out of here if you don’t wanna get hurt.
 Better not think lightly of me!
 I’m not gonna hand this guy over, no matter what!
 Ninja Dropouts…
 It’s not gonna end up with you just getting hurt.
 You’re gonna get killed.
 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Ninja Art: Blood Rain.
 Todoroki!
 Damn!
 My Jutsu isn’t Ninjutsu.
 It’s Killer Jutsu.
 Sakura!
 Lee, are you all right?
 Yeah, just barely. More importantly, where’s Naruto?
 Is everybody safe?
 Yes. However, Commander Todoroki is nowhere to be seen!
 What was that?!
 Naruto…
 Naruto…
 Die!
 Damn! Let go, you jerk!
 Naruto!
 Damn!
 Father! Mother!
 Akio!
 Akio!
 What a shame…
 You’re not getting back with your comrades.
 Todoroki! Gantetsu!
 Are you all right?!
 Y-Yeah… We’re fine.
 What are we going to do now?
 We’ve gotten separated from Sakura and Bushy Brows…
 There isn’t any question in my mind.
 It’s my mission to deliver this guy to the capital.
 But the ship’s been destroyed, and…
 Those guys are pursuing us!
 What are you doing?!
 If they’re gonna steal this guy away from us anyway,
 it would be better to take care of him right here!
 What do you mean take care of him…?
 Even if we delivered him the capital,
 it’s certain that he’ll be sentenced to death…
 Therefore…
 Rather than having them take him away, it would be better to…!
 It’s not set in stone that they’ll be able to take him away!
 Let’s go!
 Your mission is to guard this guy, right?
 That’s exactly what my mission is too!
 If you so much as try anything, your head’s gonna roll!
 Run!
 We’ll be fine… now that we’ve come this far…
 Looks like we’ve totally lost them.
 We’ve gone pretty deep into the forest, haven’t we?
 I can get our bearings from the position of the moon.
 It’s too dangerous to go back to the river.
 We’ll continue straight through this forest to the capital.
 Because it’s my mission.
 Are you sure it’ll be okay?
 What do you mean?
 You said earlier you were going to finish this guy off, right?
 I was talking about a worst-case scenario.
 Got it… Well then, let’s get moving.
 I wonder if Sakura is all right…
 Naruto…
 It’s Naruto… He’s gonna be just fine.
 Yeah…
 So let’s hurry up and link up with him!
 Lee!
 I detect something strange…
 Where…?
 Up above!
 Lee!
 Let’s follow him! The enemy might have captured Naruto!
 What’s the matter?
 We’re walking in the direction of the moon, right…?
 Then why is the moon following us?
 That’s strange…
 What’s going on…?
 The Forest of Bewilderment…
 Once you get lost you can never find you way out again.
 He talked…
 You are in custody. You’re not allowed to talk!
 Wait a second!
 The Forest of Bewilderment…
 You know something about this place?
 What do you know? Tell us!
 The Ninja Dropouts have a hide-out in this forest.
 What was that?!
 So we were escorting you through Ninja Dropout territory…?!
 This forest is perfect for a hide-out.
 The fog, the winds that sweep through the forest,
 the extreme magnetic fields…
 They all make a person lose their sense of direction.
 A person finding himself in this forest for the first time
 will never find his way out.
 I don’t believe that…
 There’s no way we won’t find our way out…?
 You guys won’t.
 Huh?
 But for me, a member of the Ninja Dropouts…
 the outcome will be different.
 I will…
 I will guide you through this forest.
 Yeah, that’s right…
 For you, a Ninja Dropout, this forest is like your backyard, right?
 Okay then, let’s have you guide us!
 Are you some kind of idiot?!
 It’s true…
 The finesse that the Ninja Dropouts showed earlier on
 makes sense if you think that this is their garden…
 And I’ll believe you when you say you have a hide-out here.
 Then even more so…
 Even more so, it's a no!
 Huh…?
 Don’t you get it?
 This guy is gonna pretend to be guiding us out of the forest
 but will actually be taking us to the hide-out.
 Todoroki…
 This is an emergency situation…
 If we don’t kill him, we’ll be killed.
 W-Wait a minute!
 Nobody’s gonna care…if this guy dies!
 Todoroki!
 What’s that…?
 I took all the money the Ninja Dropouts had stolen up to now…
 So I was tortured…
 Those guys don’t want to rescue me…
 They just want to get that money back from me.
 Once they have the money back, those guys will kill me too.
 Do you really think I’ll believe that?
 Wait a second!
 The Ninja Dropouts hide-out is here in this forest, right…?
 Which means it’s like a backyard to them too,
 just like it is for Gantetsu…
 Which means that…
 Which means that what?
 Well, since we've trespassed into their garden
 it’s likely that the Ninja Dropouts will come after us
 whether Gantetsu’s betrayed them or not…
 So I think our only option is to pin our hopes on this guy…
 Am I wrong?
 Hey, are you sure you know what you’re doing?
 Yeah, everything’s fine.
 Those guys won’t figure out this kind of circuitous route.
 Can we really trust this guy…?
 What?!
 I’m used to it’s venom. It’s nothing.
 Are you really gonna be all right?
 Yeah…
 Hey!
 What’s the matter?
 No way!
 You fell for it. You fell for it!
 Here it comes!
 Ninja Art: Crimson Mud!
 Die!
 You’re the one who fell for it!
 I combined the Shadow Clone Jutsu and the Transformation Jutsu.
 What was that?!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Now it’s my turn!
 Rasengan!
 I’m gonna strike you down!
 Don’t think it’s gonna be that easy to strike me down!
 Like I'll let you get away!
 Naruto!
 That guy! Trying to get away, huh!
 What are you doing?
 Th-That sound is…
 What?!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Rasengan!
 Thanks to you we made it…Gantetsu.
 What's with you guys?
 They want to fight, it seems.
 I won’t… I won’t be fooled. You…you…
 We’ll be safe if we just follow Gantetsu.
 Todoroki!
 Stop it, Todoroki!
 You said you were going to deliver Gantetsu to the capital, right?
 This guy…
 There’s no way I’ll forgive this guy!
 What are you talking about?!
 This guy…
 This guy killed my family… he killed my little brother!
 Wh-What was that…?
 Gantetsu…
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if I’m told that there is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 It’s true that Gantetsu may be evil,
 but how is taking revenge out on him going to change things?!
 Isn’t our mission to take Gantetsu to the capital?
 And I… I don’t think that he’s an evil person.
 Anyway, you leave me no choice if you won’t listen.
 I’ll stop you with all my strength!
 Next time: “Memory of Flames”
